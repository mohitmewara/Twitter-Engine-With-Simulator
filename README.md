# Twitter-Engine-With-Simulator
In this project, I have implemented a Twitter Clone(Engine) and a client simulator.

Execution Steps:
The steps to execute the project can be found in Report.pdf

Description:
Twitter engine has following functionality:
1. Register account
2. Send tweet. Tweets can have hashtags (e.g. #Cool) and mentions (@bestuser)
3. Subscribe to user's tweets
4. Re-tweets (so that your subscribers get an interesting tweet you got by other means)
5. Allow querying tweets subscribed to, tweets with specific hashtags, tweets in which the user is mentioned (my mentions)
6. If the user is connected, live querying of tweets
7. Implemented a tester/simulator to test the above. It Simulate periods of live connection and disconnection for users with Zipf distribution these messages re-tweets
